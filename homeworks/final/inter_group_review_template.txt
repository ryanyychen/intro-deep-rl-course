You will be assigned to review the final presentations of the other 3 groups using the rubric below. Your review should evaluate how well each component is addressed and provide a short explanation for the score you give.


# Rubric Categories

1. Introduction: Who cares, tease results
2. Related Work: Who else has done this (maybe even in the last couple of months)
3. Methods: What did you propose and what did you end up actually doing? What didn’t work? Bad results are fine as long as you can analyze why
4. Results: How well does this agent work? How much would you trust your results if your life (grade) depended on it?


# Scoring Guide (per category)

You may assign any real-valued score in the range [0, 2] based on the following rubric:

0.0 — This component was not covered at all.
0.5 — Component is covered but unclear, contains errors, seems auto-generated, or doesn’t align with the code.
1.0 — Superficially addressed: mostly correct but missing key elements, comparisons, or depth.
1.5 — Minimally acceptable: essential parts are covered with some clarity, but not in much detail.
1.75 — Strong: feature-complete and well-explained. Negative results are discussed meaningfully, and the presentation is clear.
2.0 — Exceptional: goes above and beyond in some way—e.g., thorough analysis, innovative methods, or high presentation quality.
