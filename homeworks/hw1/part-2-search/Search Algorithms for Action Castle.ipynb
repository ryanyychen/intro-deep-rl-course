    "## The Parser\n",
    "The parser is the module that handles the natural language understanding in the game.  The players enter commands in text, and the parser interprets them and performs the actions that the player intends.  This is the module with the most potential for improvement using modern natural language processing.  The implementation that I have given below only uses simple keyword matching."
