Place the mature coconut on a baking sheet, and monitor it as it bakes (you only want to bake the coconut for as long as it takes to form a crack\u2014baking it for much longer may burn it). After 15 minutes, check for cracks in the coconut. If no cracks have formed, give it another 5 minutes in the oven, or until the coconut has developed fault lines. Alternatively, microwave the coconut on high for 3 minutes. This method is handy when you\u2019re pressed for time, or don\u2019t want to fuss around with an oven. The coconut may not crack, and you may need to exert more force to open it later, but the shell will become weaker and generally easier to penetrate. Remove the coconut and wrap it in a towel to cool. Use oven mitts to retrieve the coconut from the oven or microwave, and allow it to cool for about 5 minutes while wrapped in a towel. Doing this ensures you don\u2019t have hot coconut bits flying everywhere when you go to smash it in the next step. Whack the wrapped coconut with a hammer, or bash it against a hard surface. With the coconut still wrapped in the towel, use a hammer or a mallet to repeatedly and forcefully whack the coconut. Turn the coconut as you hammer it, in order to strike it from multiple angles. Hammer it until you feel it break open beneath the towel. Separate the coconut meat from the shell with a knife. Take each coconut fragment and slip a knife between the shell and the white meat of the coconut to separate the two. Then, use the knife to remove the fibrous layer that might still be clinging to the outside of the meat, in a similar manner to how you\u2019d peel an apple.",

Position the pointed end of a screwdriver on one of the 3 holes or \u201ceyes\u201d at the top of the coconut. Then, use a mallet or hammer to carefully but forcefully bore a hole through an eye. Once the screwdriver gives (indicating it\u2019s bored through the shell), remove it by wiggling it out, widening the new hole in the process. Turn the coconut upside down over a glass and allow it to drain. Let the coconut sit for several minutes or until all of the liquid drains out. You may need to shake the coconut a few times to get the last bit of water out of it.\n\nWrap the mature coconut in a kitchen towel. Place the coconut in the center of the towel, and gather the corners of the towel together to form a pouch. This will keep coconut bits from flying when you go to smash it with a hammer. Use a hammer or mallet to firmly strike all around the coconut. Place the wrapped coconut on a solid surface and hold it in place with one hand. Then, minding your fingers, strike the coconut\u2019s center with a hammer or mallet. Turn the wrapped coconut slightly, and strike the center again. Use as much force as you can safely apply, and repeat until the coconut breaks apart beneath the towel. Alternatively, strike the coconut against a concrete surface. If you don\u2019t have a hammer or mallet, you can use a solid surface like a porch or possibly a concrete countertop. Try to strike the coconut\u2019s equator against the corner of this surface, using it as a makeshift wedge. Repeatedly strike the coconut all around its equator until the coconut breaks apart. Use a knife to separate the meat from the shell. Remove the coconut pieces from the towel. Take each piece, and wedge a knife between the shell and the white meat of the coconut to carefully separate the two. Then, use the knife (or a vegetable peeler) or remove the fibrous layer that might still be clinging to the outside of the meat.\n\n Preheat the oven to 400 \u00b0F (204 \u00b0C) and bake the coconut for 15-20 minutes. Place the mature coconut on a baking sheet, and monitor it as it bakes (you only want to bake the coconut for as long as it takes to form a crack\u2014baking it for much longer may burn it). After 15 minutes, check for cracks in the coconut. If no cracks have formed, give it another 5 minutes in the oven, or until the coconut has developed fault lines. Alternatively, microwave the coconut on high for 3 minutes. This method is handy when you\u2019re pressed for time, or don\u2019t want to fuss around with an oven. The coconut may not crack, and you may need to exert more force to open it later, but the shell will become weaker and generally easier to penetrate. Remove the coconut and wrap it in a towel to cool. Use oven mitts to retrieve the coconut from the oven or microwave, and allow it to cool for about 5 minutes while wrapped in a towel. Doing this ensures you don\u2019t have hot coconut bits flying everywhere when you go to smash it in the next step. Whack the wrapped coconut with a hammer, or bash it against a hard surface. With the coconut still wrapped in the towel, use a hammer or a mallet to repeatedly and forcefully whack the coconut. Turn the coconut as you hammer it, in order to strike it from multiple angles. Hammer it until you feel it break open beneath the towel. Separate the coconut meat from the shell with a knife.
