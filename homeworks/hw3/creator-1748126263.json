This applies to: STR, DEX, WIL, HP, PIPS, Birthsign & Disposition, Coat, and Physical Detail.\nSTR, DEX, and WIL require rolling 3d6 and keeping the two highest rolls, resulting in a number between 2-12. These numbers should be generated by 3d6kh2.\nSome attributes like coat and physical detail require two separate rolls, so you should perform the specified dice rolls separately and use the results to determine the final attribute.\nThe description should be based on all of the other attributes, as well as the items that come with the character. You can use the same hp and pips values as you used for the background to determine the items.\nCreate the mouse by calling the 'make_mouse' function.\n","name":null,"tool_call_id":null,"tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":null},{"role":"assistant","content":null,"name":null,"tool_call_id":null,"tool_calls":[{"id":"call_UQvFGcIEWSfMc5PNv5Fllj1i","type":"function","function":{"name":"roll","arguments":"{\"dice_roll\": \"3d6kh2\"}"}},{"id":"call_07lr1nXhOrxTbWAjzgNDe09L","type":"function","function":{"name":"roll","arguments":"{\"dice_roll\": \"3d6kh2\"}"}},{"id":"call_uATNWeQzSg6FNQ0j2fbkWm1K","type":"function","function":{"name":"roll","arguments":"{\"dice_roll\": \"3d6kh2\"}"}},{"id":"call_sZ5NWJ9eZ3d737j2fwaYctYu","type":"function","function":{"name":"roll","arguments":"{\"dice_roll\": \"1d6\"}"}},{"id":"call_ll1bTAwZx017oT7oQ0SRGbYx","type":"function","function":{"name":"roll","arguments":"{\"dice_roll\": \"1d6\"}"}},{"id":"call_dvBDQ0ZmGmCxfYqOuWltw0og","type":"function","function":{"name":"roll","arguments":"{\"dice_roll\": \"1d6\"}"}},{"id":"call_CKduaHAoPY97t6gB3gAcmLWe","type":"function","function":{"name":"roll","arguments":"{\"dice_roll\": \"1d6\"}"}},{"id":"call_L5xX64ntyJ9ySALdaUKmocdt","type":"function","function":{"name":"roll","arguments":"{\"dice_roll\": \"1d6\"}"}}],"is_tool_call_error":null},{"role":"function","content":"3d6kh2 (~~**1**~~, **6**, **6**) = `12`","name":"roll","tool_call_id":"call_UQvFGcIEWSfMc5PNv5Fllj1i","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false},{"role":"function","content":"3d6kh2 (5, 5, ~~5~~) = `10`","name":"roll","tool_call_id":"call_07lr1nXhOrxTbWAjzgNDe09L","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false},{"role":"function","content":"3d6kh2 (~~**1**~~, 3, 2) = `5`","name":"roll","tool_call_id":"call_uATNWeQzSg6FNQ0j2fbkWm1K","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false},{"role":"function","content":"1d6 (5) = `5`","name":"roll","tool_call_id":"call_sZ5NWJ9eZ3d737j2fwaYctYu","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false},{"role":"function","content":"1d6 (2) = `2`","name":"roll","tool_call_id":"call_ll1bTAwZx017oT7oQ0SRGbYx","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false},{"role":"function","content":"1d6 (4) = `4`","name":"roll","tool_call_id":"call_dvBDQ0ZmGmCxfYqOuWltw0og","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false},{"role":"function","content":"1d6 (**6**) = `6`","name":"roll","tool_call_id":"call_CKduaHAoPY97t6gB3gAcmLWe","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false},{"role":"function","content":"1d6 (5) = `5`","name":"roll","tool_call_id":"call_L5xX64ntyJ9ySALdaUKmocdt","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false},{"role":"assistant","content":null,"name":null,"tool_call_id":null,"tool_calls":[{"id":"call_FLkYYuaMTdNjI0y5isKGXUKz","type":"function","function":{"name":"determine_background","arguments":"{\"hp\": 5, \"pips\": 2}"}},{"id":"call_TH7EzK953qfFwDN5hU8u7Pk6","type":"function","function":{"name":"determine_items","arguments":"{\"hp\": 5, \"pips\": 2}"}},{"id":"call_tSOsnMtQdMIEpUCvCtbfOVL0","type":"function","function":{"name":"get_birthsign_and_disposition","arguments":"{\"birthsign\": 4}"}},{"id":"call_skcqovGnCRaNikDWWCiXX6PZ","type":"function","function":{"name":"get_coat","arguments":"{\"coat\": 6, \"pattern\": 5}"}},{"id":"call_FIomSvjJ5Y1F8Y9Kk3YThsMp","type":"function","function":{"name":"get_physical_detail","arguments":"{\"num1\": 4, \"num2\": 5}"}}],"is_tool_call_error":null},{"role":"function","content":"Cartographer","name":"determine_background","tool_call_id":"call_FLkYYuaMTdNjI0y5isKGXUKz","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false},{"role":"function","content":"('Quill & ink', 'Compass')","name":"determine_items","tool_call_id":"call_TH7EzK953qfFwDN5hU8u7Pk6","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false},{"role":"function","content":"('Storm', 'Generous / Wrathful')","name":"get_birthsign_and_disposition","tool_call_id":"call_tSOsnMtQdMIEpUCvCtbfOVL0","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false},{"role":"function","content":"Blue, Marbled","name":"get_coat","tool_call_id":"call_skcqovGnCRaNikDWWCiXX6PZ","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false},{"role":"function","content":"Frizzy fur","name":"get_physical_detail","tool_call_id":"call_FIomSvjJ5Y1F8Y9Kk3YThsMp","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false},{"role":"assistant","content":null,"name":null,"tool_call_id":null,"tool_calls":[{"id":"call_TsAXKVKHRUiRW2QwaXPaxjvk","type":"function","function":{"name":"make_mouse","arguments":"{\"strength\":12,\"dexterity\":10,\"will\":5,\"hp\":5,\"pips\":2,\"background\":\"Cartographer\",\"birthsign\":\"Storm\",\"disposition\":\"Generous / Wrathful\",\"coat\":\"Blue, Marbled\",\"physical_detail\":\"Frizzy fur\",\"name\":\"Maple Skye\",\"description\":\"Maple Skye is a talented cartographer adorned with a striking blue marbled coat that reflects her adventurous spirit.
