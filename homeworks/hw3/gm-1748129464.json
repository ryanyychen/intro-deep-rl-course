The entrance is guarded by scavengers, and he’s got a couple of other henchmen to help him keep watch.”\n\nHe takes a deep breath, gathering himself as he speaks on. “I overheard Grix talking about a raid he plans to carry out on Whisker Hollow!

Grizzle greets you with a knowing nod, his whiskers twitching with curiosity. “Back for more gear, eh? You lot planning something?”\n\nYou quickly explain the situation. “We’re preparing to confront Grix and his gang. We need whatever weapons you can spare.”\n\nGrizzle scratches his chin thoughtfully. “Well, I have a few things that might help.” He leads you to a corner where he shows you:\n\n1. **Twig Swords** - basic but effective weapons for close combat.\n2. **Sharp Pebble Daggers** - for quick and precise strikes, handy for stealthy approaches.\n3. **Wooden Shields** - small but useful for protecting yourself during a fight.\n4. **Slingshots** - to launch small projectiles from a distance.\n\nYou can assign any combination of these weapons to your group as you see fit.

You can feel their sturdy weight in your paws, reassuring you of the support they will provide in the heat of battle.\n\nOnce you have equipped everyone, Grizzle gives you an approving nod. “Good luck out there, and be careful!

If all goes well, you may even come across Squeaky's knowledge of tracking to scout ahead for further reconnaissance.\n\nAfter a careful journey, you find a small clearing where Flick waits, concealed in the underbrush. He looks up, his eyes wide with hope upon seeing your expanding group. “You made it!” he exclaims, relief washing over him as he notes the extra mice with weapons at the ready.\n\nAlongside Flick, you see a couple more familiar faces emerge from the foliage—**Bee**, a sharpshooting mouse known for her keen eye with a slingshot, and **Nibbles**, a clever strategist who often helps plan village defenses. \n\n“Looks like you’ve brought reinforcements,” Flick comments, glancing at your assembled team. “That’s great!

We know Grix is in an abandoned burrow deep in the Enshadowed Grove. Flick, since you know the area, you’ll help guide us there and scout ahead just in case.”\n\nFlick nods, eager to contribute. “I’ll find us a good vantage point to watch for any sentries or movements.”\n\n“Dapple,” you continue, “you and Bee will work together to create a distraction. Once Flick gives the signal, I want you two to throw rocks or make noise on the opposite side of Grix's burrow to draw his guards away. Use your speed to get in and out quickly.”\n\nDapple beams with excitement. “Got it! This will be fun!”\n\n“Maggie and Rusty,” you say, “you’ll be at the front with me. We’ll move in to face Grix and confront him if he tries to block our way or retaliates.

You all head deeper into the woods, moving with stealth and determination toward Grix’s lair.\n\nAs you approach, the air is thick with tension. Your allies move with purpose, ready to engage in the battle ahead. Flick suddenly pauses, raising a paw to signal for silence.\n\n“Over there,” he whispers, pointing to a couple of shady figures lounging outside the burrow—Grix's henchmen, unaware of the approaching tide of mice seeking justice.\n\nWhat will you do next, Maple Skye?

He nods, understanding the task at hand. “I’ll draw their attention,” he says confidently, clutching his slingshot.\n\nYou watch as Squeaky stealthily moves into position, keeping himself low against the underbrush. He crouches behind a nearby bush and readies a small pebble in his slingshot. With precision, he aims towards a distant cluster of foliage, where the sound of rustling could give the henchmen the distraction they need.\n\nWith a swift motion, Squeaky releases the pebble. It flies through the air, landing with a soft thud among the leaves, and immediately draws the attention of the henchmen. They perk up, glancing at each other in confusion before one of them saunters off, heading toward the source of the sound.\n\n“Now’s our chance!” you whisper urgently to the group. “Let’s move!”\n\nYou lead the charge, along with Maggie and Rusty, while Dapple and Bee stay back, ready to provide a secondary distraction if necessary. Flick, following closely, helps guide you toward a concealed entrance to Grix’s burrow, where the remaining henchman is distracted by the noise.\n\nAs you approach, the tension is palpable. You can see the entrance looming ahead, overgrown with vines and shadows. Suddenly, you hear a growl from behind—Grix has emerged from his lair, eyes narrowed and furious, clearly alerted by the disturbance.\n\n“Who dares disturb my peace?!” he snarls, brandishing a makeshift weapon of his own.\n\nYou have the upper hand in numbers, and the time has come to implement your plan.

Can you set up something to help us?”\n\n“I’ve got just the thing!” Pip replies, pulling out a small contraption—a net trap. “I’ll set this up to catch Grix off guard while we keep him busy!”\n\nYou nod, and while Pip discreetly sets up the trap behind Grix, you continue to maintain the formation, watching as he shifts, still growling and sizing you all up. \n\n“Are you mice really foolish enough to confront me?” Grix taunts, taking a step closer as Maggie and Rusty grip their weapons tighter. \n\nWith a swift motion, you signal to Pip to activate the trap.

They move in tandem with you, every step filled with determination. Grix, realizing the combined force against him, snarls and struggles harder against the net, but you can see he’s starting to tire.\n\nYou confront Grix, shield raised, ready to defend against any retaliatory moves he might make. “This is the end of your reign of terror!” you declare, purposefully brandishing your shield and preparing to strike with your weapon.\n\nMaggie and Rusty press in, using their strength to push Grix back against the confines of the net. “You’ll never get away with this!” Grix spits, clawing at the ropes, his anger fueled by frustration.\n\nAs the fight intensifies, you take your chance and swing your weapon.
