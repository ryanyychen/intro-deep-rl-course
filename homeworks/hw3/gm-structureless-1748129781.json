Just last night, we lost half of our carrots! The elder mice say they’ve heard strange rustling noises near the edge of the woods, but no one has seen what’s going on.”\n\nAnother mouse, a wiry fellow with a twitching nose, pipes up, “Some of us think it could be a rogue squirrel or even some strange creature. If you could help us investigate, we’d be most grateful!

The trees in the woods loom ahead, their trunks twisting and bending in ways that make them seem almost alive.

You kneel down to get a better look and see that they are quite fresh—the earth around them is still soft and undisturbed.\n\nFollowing the trail, you also notice bits of green leaves and slightly crushed plants that seem to align with the timeline of the disappearances back in Miceworth.

The sunlight filters in through the leaves, creating a serene atmosphere, but something feels off. In the center of the glade, you spot a large burrow partially hidden beneath a tangle of roots. Surrounding it are bits of greenery—herbs, flowers, and even a few of the very vegetables that had gone missing from Miceworth!\n\nAs you approach the burrow, you notice some movement at the entrance. Two curious eyes peer out at you from the shadows. They belong to a plump, bushy-tailed critter—a squirrel that seems to have made this burrow a temporary home.

It seems you have quite the collection of plants here. Mind if I ask what’s going on?”\n\nThe squirrel tilts its head, dropping the carrot and wiping its paws on the grass. “Oh, hey there, little mouse! I didn’t mean to cause any trouble. I’m Sam, and I’ve just been… well, gathering supplies! You see, this past winter was rough, and I thought I’d prepare for the next one by collecting as much food as I could find.”\n\n“I didn’t think anyone would mind a few carrots or herbs, but if the mouse town is upset, I can stop.

What do you propose? I can’t exactly just buy food, but I'm willing to help in other ways.

The mice can help you find safe places for storing your food, and in return, you'll leave the gardens of Miceworth alone.”\n\nSam thinks it over, scratching his chin with a paw. “I can do that! I’ll return the veggies I’ve taken and help protect the gardens in exchange for some seeds. We can even set up a system where we can trade food efficiently without stepping on each other’s toes.”\n\nFeeling optimistic, you extend your paw for a shake on the deal. “It’s a deal, Sam!
